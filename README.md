# Dilatometry-analysis
The Master Fitter code can be used to analyzed dilatometry results on hypoeutectoid steels. This code uses a technique called Unit Cell Dilaiton (UCD). For detailed explanation of UCD please refere to the paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044580317324051">"Unit cell dilation technique for analyzing dilatometry data in microalloyed steels"</a>. For even more in depth explanation of the method please refere the my PhD thesis titled <a href="https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/079669b6-d108-4c89-86ed-4e067600c57c">"A fundamental method to quantify phase change in microalloyed steels"</a>. 

<h1> Dilatometry basics </h1>

Dilatometry is an material charackterization technique in which change in dimension of a sample is recorded as a function of temperature and time. It is one the most accurate and sensative methods to study phase transformation in materials espacially when there is a relatively large difference in the density of the phases. One such material is steel in which a high density austenite phase transforms to multitude of lower density microconstituents and phases such polygonal ferrite, pearlite, bainitic ferrite, bainite, martensite and retained austenite. In simple phase transformation interpretting dilatometry data is relatively easy using so called "lever rule". However, for a complex system such as microallyed steel which often producess more than two kinds of product phase "lever rule" is out right wrong. The reason for this is explained in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044580317324051">"Unit cell dilation technique for analyzing dilatometry data in microalloyed steels"</a>.
